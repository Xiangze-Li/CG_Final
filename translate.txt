The collision of small ball and thin rod is a difficult topic in the rigid-body part of universe physics educating. 
The conclusion is drawn, from analysis and cauculation given in this article, that the total external torque upon the system of the ball and rod is zero or apprximatly zero ordinarily, which gives the consevation of the systemâ€™s angular momentum. 
When collision occurs between a small ball and a thin rod placed vertically or on frictionless horizontal surface, if the rod is not fixed to a frictionless axle, the total momentum or one component of momentum conservates. Otherwise, if the rod is fixed to a frictionless axle, it is possible that one component of momentum conservates, only under the circumstances that the collision occurs on a specific point on the rod. 
After the collision, it is possible that the ball continues moving forward, halts or being bounced backward, if the restitution coefficient e is not zero thus kenetic energy does not conservate. If e is zero, the ball will adhere to the rod, and rotates together with the rod centering on the fixed axle or the center of mass of ball-rod system.
